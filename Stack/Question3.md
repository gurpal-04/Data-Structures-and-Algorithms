## Implement a program to evaluate a postfix expression.

### Input Format

The first input will be a single integer N denoting the number of test cases to take. After this there will be exactly N lines, each line a valid postfix string. The string will be a valid postfix expression consisting of only integers and binary operators (+, -, *, / and ?).

Every integer and operator will be compulsorily separated by a SPACE. The symbol ‘?’ denotes the end of expression.


### Output Format

Exactly N lines, each line denoting the output of the expression. In case the output is in fractions, please print only the integer part of the output.
